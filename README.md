It is my second project. Dont be strict with me :stuck_out_tongue: It's a training project. I made it with one purpouse - study new technologies such as redux, express, scss, react routing etc. 

If you want to download this project on your computer and then run it. You need to create in `timon` folder a file `.env` and put there your API key  

```javascript
    API_KEY_NEWS = yourkey
```
The API key i got here [newsapi.orgt](https://newsapi.org/) .

To start server - go to the `server` directory and enter in the terminal `npm run dev`. 

And then go to the timon folder and enter in terminal `npm start`.

In this project I made a simple server with express. On server side I processed POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests.

On the Form page you can add new article and then this article will save in article.json file on server side Also you can find the articles by date, edit the articles and delete it. If you prefer the dark or light theme, you can swith it with toogle button in header. This application is adaptive. On other pages you can watch some articles or news.
